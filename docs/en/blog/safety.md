# Website security

## What happened?
Recently, some students of class 8 threatened to attack the class website.           

## Is the website still safe?
This website relies on GitHub pages. There are two local website data backups (offense database and homework database), which are archived and stored in iCloud parcel service. The source code even went directly with other GitHub codes to the South Pole. GitHub, as the largest code hosting platform in the world, just cannot be easily broken by middle school students.

## What did you do?
Just in case, we have strengthened the website security.      
If you are an ordinary visitor, you may also be intercepted. It's OK. Just enter the captcha.          
Thank you for your understanding and support!
