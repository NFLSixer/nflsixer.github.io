# Updated website!

## Why is it updated？
In order to maintain the stability of the site, we have chosen to no longer host our site on the CNBlogs garden and have created a new site.

## What are the changes？
The overall structure of the site has not changed, we have moved the menu bar to the left and created an English site.

## Will you forget to upload homework？
Probably not. We will try our best to upload homework on time.

## Happy 2021, the Year of the Ox!
